============
Helper functions for inserting waveforms into glitchy noise
============

`get_glitchy_times` returns a list of glitchy times and glitchless times from a glitch file and a list of valid times.

`get_glitchy_gps_time` takes a list of valid times from `get_valid_noise_times` and a glitchy time from `get_glitchy_times` 
and offsets the glitchy time to ensure the glitch occurs in the SNR time series. This is necessary for BNS and NSBH samples,
as the peak frequency of the glitch can be tens of seconds from the merger.
